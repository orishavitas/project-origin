## Usage

Load `ORIGIN.md` as system prompt. Inject this prompt with parsed request data.

```

<task type="analyze">
<n>Analyze Information Gaps and Recommend Questions</n>

<input>
<parsed_request>
{{parsed_request_json}}
</parsed_request>

<clarification_round>{{round_number}}</clarification_round>
<previous_questions>{{previous_questions_if_any}}</previous_questions>
</input>

<instructions>
Analyze the parsed request and determine if clarification is needed.

1. GAP SEVERITY ASSESSMENT
   Evaluate each gap against MRD requirements:
   
   BLOCKING (must clarify before proceeding):
   - No target market identified
   - No use cases described
   - Product concept too vague to research
   
   IMPORTANT (should clarify if round available):
   - No price target
   - No volume expectation
   - Missing device compatibility
   
   MINOR (can proceed and note in MRD):
   - No specific timeline
   - Design preferences unclear
   - Materials not specified

2. DECISION: CLARIFY OR PROCEED
   
   IF clarification_round < 2 AND blocking_gaps exist:
     → Generate clarification questions
   
   IF clarification_round >= 2:
     → Proceed to research, note remaining gaps
   
   IF no blocking_gaps AND important_gaps <= 2:
     → Proceed to research

3. QUESTION GENERATION (if clarifying)
   
   Rules:
   - Maximum 5 questions
   - Prioritize by: target_market > use_cases > price > technical > volume > timeline
   - Offer multiple-choice where possible
   - Include brief context for why each question matters
   - Do not repeat previous_questions
   
   Question format:
   - Clear, specific, single-topic
   - Provide examples or options where helpful
   - Explain impact on MRD quality

4. OUTPUT DECISION
   Return one of:
   - "clarify": Questions to send
   - "proceed": Ready for research
   - "escalate": Human intervention needed (rare)

Before returning, verify:
- [ ] decision matches gap severity assessment
- [ ] If clarifying: questions <= 5, no repeats from previous_questions
- [ ] If proceeding: gaps_to_flag captures all unresolved items
- [ ] Questions are prioritized correctly
- [ ] Each question has context explaining its importance
