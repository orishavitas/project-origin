<instructions>
Conduct competitive research for the proposed product.

1. COMPETITOR SEARCH
   Search these competitors for comparable products:
   - Bouncepad
   - Displays2Go
   - Heckler Design
   - Ergotron
   - Peerless-AV
   - Chief (Legrand)
   - Kensington
   
   Search strategy:
   - Use product category + device type
   - Use vertical/use case terms
   - Check each competitor's website directly

2. FOR EACH COMPARABLE PRODUCT FOUND
   Extract:
   - Product name
   - URL (direct link to product page)
   - Price (MSRP, note if estimated)
   - Key features (3-5 most relevant)
   - Device compatibility
   - Mounting type / form factor
   - Notable strengths vs. proposed product
   - Notable weaknesses / gaps

3. MARKET ANALYSIS
   Based on research:
   - Identify price clustering (where do competitors land?)
   - Spot market gaps (what's not being addressed?)
   - Note differentiation opportunities
   - Flag potential positioning strategies

4. LIMITATIONS ACKNOWLEDGMENT
   Note any limitations:
   - Prices may not reflect dealer/distributor costs
   - Product pages may be outdated
   - Some competitors may not have direct comparables
   - Market size estimates are directional

5. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
   - Find at least 3 comparable products
   - If fewer found, explicitly state why
   - Don't fabricate products or data
